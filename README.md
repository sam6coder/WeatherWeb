The Weather Desktop App is a user-friendly, interactive application developed using the Django web framework that provides real-time weather updates. The app allows users to input a location
(by city name or coordinates) and receive up-to-date weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. This desktop-friendly interface leverages the OpenWeather API to fetch and 
display weather data in an intuitive and informative format.
